# GP 2021 - Egypt Shops

XShop is a SaaS subscription-based Inventory system where shops and local supermarket owners can register online and get access to fully-featured inventory system with minor hassle...

**Problems with current systems:**

- High cost (a supermarket has to pay large amount upfront) it would be a huge loss for them if they closed their business, too
- Fixed amount of features
- System updates/changes are very costly
- Need on-premise existence of tech individuals
- High risk of data loss
- Needs regular maintenance and IT guys inside shops to build local network and stuff like that

**With XShop:**

- Low cost as you pay monthly a small amount of money
- Clients (shop owners) get updates with no extra fees
- Low cost on the company as the business can grow based on account registration
- no special equipment needed.. Just a mobile phone/tablet or a computer
- Data is kept and backed up automatically for the clients
- No IT Guys required, Everything is online.. Support is given by phone or online
